Readme

This Python implementation takes the Iris dataset of 3 species, breaks it down into 2 species. 
Only these 2 species are used for classification. 
A support vector machine model is used for this classifier. 
Future work would look at introducing more features as only 2 of the 4 features were used.

The code was inspired by work done here:
